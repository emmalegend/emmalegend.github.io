        <li>I am honored and privileged to have spent my entire life knowing and having Linda as my Sister.</li>
        <br>
<li>We say that the hour of death cannot be forecast, but when we say this we imagine that hour in an obscure and distant future. It never occurs to us that it has any connection with the day already begun or that death could arrive that same afternoon.</li>
<br>
<li>Linda, Daughter, Mother Friend and my Sister, I will miss you terribly. I wasn't ready for you to go yet! We were just planning your Birthday Lunch at Red Lobster. Our yearly reminder of all the fun we had in Maine as kids and teenagers!! </li>
<br>
<li>One thing I think is that everyone who knew Linda knew how generous and caring a person she was. There wasn't one time at the close of a visit or conversation that she would always, without fail say, "Let me know if you need anything. Love you!" And you know in your heart that she meant it!</li><br>
<li>Linda's life was short lived yet I know she had many future plans. One in particular she was looking forward to with love and excitement is the upcoming birth of her new grandson later this year. </li>
<br>
<li>We can all be certain that she will make herself known in Spirit to her kids and their families, and especially to the expected baby, Kessler.</li>
<br>
<li>I am confident that Linda is now with our creator. I thank you for my sister Linda and for allowing me to became part of her life's journey. She will be in our hearts forever.</li>
